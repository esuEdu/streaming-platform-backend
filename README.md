# Streaming Platform

Welcome to **Streaming Platform* â€“ a streaming platform inspired by Twitch, built to help you learn and experiment with microservices architecture!

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience with microservices. By building a streaming platform, youâ€™ll explore how to design, develop, and deploy distributed systems, just like the ones used by large-scale platforms such as Twitch.

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

By working on MicroStream, you will:

- Understand the fundamentals of microservices architecture
- Learn how to split a monolithic app into independent services
- Practice inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, messaging)
- Implement service discovery, load balancing, and scaling
- Explore CI/CD, containerization, and orchestration
